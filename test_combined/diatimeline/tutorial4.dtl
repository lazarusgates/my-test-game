jenny: That's one down. Nice job!

derek: <Empty Text Event>
- You too. Thanks for teaching me.
	[style name="test_bubbles_right"]
	jenny: Aww, you're welcome! We're not done yet, though. There's still one more.
- That was too easy.
	[style name="test_bubbles_right"]
	jenny: Don't get ahead of yourself- there's still one more.
jenny: I've got another lesson for you. Do you see that symbol next to the bot?
jenny: That symbol represents the bot's "genre". Everything's got a genre- bots and people alike.
jenny: The bot we attacked earlier was a Rock bot, but this one is a Noise bot. Can you see the difference?
jenny: Just like bots, songs also have genres. The song I taught you earlier is in the Pop genre, of course.
jenny: But watch what happens when we try to attack a Noise bot with a Pop song.
[wait time="1.0"]
jenny: See how it did less damage? That's because Pop is weak against Noise. This means hitting it with a Pop song is less effective.
jenny: However, Noise is weak to Alt. I bet you can guess what that means.
jenny: Here, listen to this.
[wait time="1.1"]
Noise bots take extra damage when hit with Alt songs!
jenny: Each genre has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's important you learn and practice songs from each of them.
Go ahead and take out this last bot. I'll let you pick how to do it- by chipping it down slowly with the easy Pop attack, or trying for big damage with the more difficult Alt song.

(You might have trouble remembering every song, what they do, and how to play them.)
(If you need a refresher during a battle, pick the "Songs" option on the menu. You can check how to play each song, their genre, and their effects.)
(Then, when you're ready, return to the battle menu and pick "Attack" to try and play the song yourself.)
